# Discord Radio Bot ðŸŽ§

A proof-of-concept radio bot for Discord.js. Streams audio from a hardware device on your computer (e.g. your output speaker, input microphone) over a Discord voice channel.

**Works on:**

- Linux (via PulseAudio `pulse`)
- Windows (via DirectShow `dshow`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies - `npm install`
3. Configure `data/config.json`
	- See below for system-specific details.
4. Start! - `npm start`

## Configuring on Windows via `dshow`

Run `ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy` and observe output containing something similar:

```
DirectShow audio devices
 "Stereo Mix (Realtek(R) Audio)"
    Alternative name "@device_cm_{ID1}\wave_{ID2}"
```

For example, playing the above device will mirror audio from the speaker output of your machine. Your `config.json` should then be considered like so:

```json
{
  "token": "discord_bot_token",
  "owner": "discord_user_id",
  "prefix": "-",
  "device": "Stereo Mix (Realtek(R) Audio)",
  "type": "dshow",
  "maxTransmissionGap": 5000,
  "activity": null
}
```

## Configuring on Linux via `pulse`

Run `pactl list short sources` and observe output containing something similar:

```
5   alsa_output.pci.3.analog-stereo.monitor   module-alsa-card.c   s16le 2ch 44100Hz   IDLE
```

Then configure your `config.json` with the device you'd like to use:

```json
{
  "token": "discord_bot_token",
  "owner": "discord_user_id",
  "prefix": "-",
  "device": "alsa_output.pci.3.analog-stereo.monitor",
  "type": "pulse",
  "maxTransmissionGap": 5000,
  "activity": null
}
```

## Configuring Activity

Have your music player output some JSON output.
Then configure your `config.json` with the input to read from and the format for the bot to use as its activity: 

```json
{
  "token": "discord_bot_token",
  "owner": "discord_user_id",
  "prefix": "-",
  "device": "alsa_output.pci.3.analog-stereo.monitor",
  "type": "pulse",
  "maxTransmissionGap": 5000,
  "activity": {
    "input": "~/now_playing.json",
    "format": "$artist - $title"
  }
}
```
